# Mechalino_Arena

## Final goal: Implement the SCPP algorithm to Mechalino robots

### Step 1.0:
Visualize single layer Mechalino robots in Unity 3D with a ROS backend
### Step 2.0:
Re-implement the SCPP algorithm in ROS
### Step 2.1:
Run the SCPP algorithm in ROS while robots are doing the same movements
### Step 3.0:
Visualize two-layer Mechalino (with sensors) in Unity 3D with a ROS backend
### Step 3.1:
Run the SCPP algorithm in ROS while robots are doing the movements and also delivering sensor data (obstacle detection)
### Step 3.2:
Use two-layer Mechalino robots to run the SCPP algorithm independently and Visualize the result in Unity 3D with a ROS backend

For sure this is just a raw list and will change.
