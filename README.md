# Mechalino Arena

## Final goal:
Implement the SCPP algorithm to Mechalino robots
## Planned steps::
 - [X] **Step 1.0** - Visualize single layer Mechalino robots in Unity 3D with a ROS backend
 - [ ] **Step 2.0** - Re-implement the SCPP algorithm in ROS
 - [ ] **Step 2.1** - Run the SCPP algorithm in ROS while robots are doing the same movements
 - [ ] **Step 3.0** - Visualize two-layer Mechalino (with sensors) in Unity 3D with a ROS backend
 - [ ] **Step 3.1** - Run the SCPP algorithm in ROS while robots are doing the movements and also delivering sensor data (obstacle detection)
 - [ ] **Step 3.2** - Use two-layer Mechalino robots to run the SCPP algorithm independently and Visualize the result in Unity 3D with a ROS backend

  **[Temporary note]** Current status:  After completing Step 1, the arena works in its elementary form. Working on the project is now pending the submission of my ***overdue articles***.
